Have you every been hit with a ton of bricks and have the "AHA!" moment? That moment when you feel in your gut this is the place you want to be, grow professionally, and the people you what to do that along side. After today, my experience turned my gut feeling into a reality. 

What have I been doing to make it happen?
* Studying code at Flatiron and taking a break to job search and while I job search take EXTRA classes to gain more skills in the tech industry (forever a student)
* Finding that what I've been doing all along is something I will always been passionate about, helping people (ESFJ on Myers Briggs test. I feel it's natural to want to see those around you succeed.
* I'm HUGE on communication and enjoy building relationships. 
* I enjoying contributing to the improvement of processes to make things more efficient

What I've done to show this?
* Study Code - Tutorials, Full Stack Developer Programs, Meetups
* Marketing - Event Coordinate, Outreach, Vendor Communication, Amway, Mary Kay, Door to door sales
* Process Improvement - Develop documentation and training people, help develop new and streamline existing processes
* Networking - Building lasting relationships within the community

This last year especially I feel like I've grow so much as a person and found confirmation in all the things I knew all along. I want to explore further and grow as an individual in more ways than one. Fingers cross because the next chapter in my life is just around the corner!
