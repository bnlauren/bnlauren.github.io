I decided to learn software development because of PokemonGo! THE END....

No, not really. How web applications, software, phone apps, etc. are developed has always been an interest of mine. It all started out in high school when some of my friends and I built the school website. We had alot of practice as our supervisor kept "organizing" the folders thus having us rebuild it again and again, haha. My parents would ask me if I was going into webdesign for my undergrad but from what I understood at the time the market was saturated with people who knew web development, thus, I chose to pursue a degree in Mechancial Engineering.

Upon graduating high school and going to college I acquired a work/study position as the Assistant Webmaster for the College of Engineering and Science. When my boss retired he talked to the school and I was able to remain in my position until his replacement was found. It felt pretty cool to manage the website all on my own for 6 months until the college hired someone. I also helped train the new employee. It was maintained using Photoshop and Macromedia Studio. While I was in college, I also designed and built a website for a local heath center and managed it up to a year after graduation.

At my first job as a Project Engineer my boss requested I manage the SharePoint site for our department since I had webdesign experience. Following that position, upon moving to Colorado and working as a Specification Specialist, my boss there requested a build 2 SharePoint sites and manage them as well.

Now, at the age of 31, my friend and I decided to start a blog about how to be financially savvy and experience everything you want in life. Faced with the issue of learning code to build a fully functioning site I decided to learn WordPress. 

Through my experience with SharePoint and WordPress I learned they were much more limiting and I prefer building everything from scratch. This combined with the ambitions of several of my friends and I wanting to build apps I have felt like something keeps drawing me back into this world of coding. Reflecting upon this I came to the following conclusions:
* I will have the opportunity to build a clientele base and manage their websites
* With our site, PennyNinjas, I would have full control of all attributes without having to rely of WordPress for designs

Now after been laid off from my position I was at a crossroads. Do I want to maintain a career as a mechanical engineer or do I want to dive in while I have this opportunity? Everything I'm feeling told me to looking into coding so I decided to look into bootcamps and who better to ask than Google? I needed an option where I could attend a coding bootcamp online. While I would love to attend in person I need to have the flexibility to acquire a job while I attend school. Flatiron School had everything I was looking for: a massive support system (even the Co-Founder/Dean logs in and answers questions), great curriculum (my friend who's a developer also reviewed the curriculum and thought it was great), and dedicated career services.

Let's be honest, the reality is as times progress the more integrated our society gets into technology. With the growing need there's alot of job security which is definitely a plus. Last but not least there's nothing more rewarding than finding that random line of code that's been messing up your program after hours of searching (a maybe a tylenol or two later). 

After gaining developer experience I'd like to expand upon that in a product role. Having the ability to code and help guide the evolution of the product while also building relationships sounds like a dream job. I can't wait until graduation, time to get the ball rolling!
