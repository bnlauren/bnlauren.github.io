I should be to my first assesment soon but first a detour to study more python.....why you ask, currently I'm just a beginner and I'd like to become advanced in it. I have, hopefully, a second interview coming, the first phone interview went very well! Not sure if it's truly a detour because I know as a developer this is something I should become advanced in. The position is with a local company and I'm also interviewing with 2 other companies this week. Which ever position I receive after finishing the course I can wait for an opening at my chosen company and move to a position where I can utilize more of the skills I've learned. I'm not concerned about losing them as I'm going to be busy building the blog site my friend and I have in mind along with my dad's site and a few others. 

I want to be the type of asset to a company where I can be used mutiple places if there's a need, whether it be Project Manager / Software Engineer or Web Infrastructure / Software Engineer (more coding). It would make things much more exciting and I'm ready for a challenge. I'm not the type of coder that hides behind a desk but the type that likes to engage with others, collaborate, and build lasting relationships. That's one reason I'm a good Project Manager. 

Just call me Dorthy because I've arrived in OZ and I'm not afraid of the wicked Queen! Let's get this ball rolling on this awesome journey I've begun. I can wait to see where it takes me!!!!
