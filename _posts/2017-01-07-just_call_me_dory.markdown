I'm sure you've all seen Finding Nemo and by now you should have seen Finding Dory as well. Life has been totally crazy these last couple of months. From the deaths/terminal illnesses of family and friends close to me to my water heater breaking. All over the course of 2 months. Not sure what was going on with 2016, but I'm sure glad it's over.

Time for new beginnings, starting with searching for a job. My schedule is divided as follows: 60% job hunting (bills are important), 30% studying, and 10% other (ie. sleep, eat, errands). So far I've applied to close to 200 positions over the last month. With the holidays just ending I hope to hear something soon.

The goal is to reach my first assesment by end of January. Currently, I'm doing hashes and have found the hashes need to be hashed! They are definitely evil but I'm not giving up. As of right now I'm attempting to finish Procedural Ruby by Monday. Then over the next two weeks I'll attempt to finish Object Oriented Ruby then I'll be to my first assesment, YAY! After that I think I'll break for a bit and focus on Javascript as I'd like to have that under my belt sooner rather than later. After being derailed for so long it's time to start practing my ABC again (Always Be Coding).

With that being said I'm reminded of Dory. Lots of time people wonder how one fish (or person) can do so much. Dory got lost, found Marlin, and helped him find Nemo. There's alot of ocean out there but Dory was able to help Marlin find Nemo, which sounds unbelievable but she never thought it was impossible. Next, even with her short term memory loss, she found her parents. I feel like all of us learners are Dories swimming in a huge ocean and sometimes we become Marlins and Nemos who need just a little help. The important thing to remember is no matter what they encounter: sharks, sea gulls, or even cute little girls with scary teeth; we have to remember to focus on the end goal. If we "just keep swimming" eventually we'll find our way home.
